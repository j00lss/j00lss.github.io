    <h1>Design examples</h1>
    <div class="top">
      <p class="preamble">Once, back in 2004-2006, I worked as a full-stack designer. I did art direction, design and <span><dfn>final art</dfn><em>(originalare)</em></span> for web and print. Some clients were my own, but other was through my work with Miami Advertising in Gothenburg.</p>
      <p>Here follows some examples of my work.</p>

    <div class="body">
      <h2>City Trollhättan</h2>
      <p>Logo and graphic manual. City Trollhättan is an association of shop owners in central Trollhättan, Sweden. The logo was designed specifically to work in a busy shop environment.
      I wanted the logo to be timeless and not intrude on any other designs. and to be visible from angles (like on a clerk desk).</p>
      <p>The logo was used for about ten years until replaced around 2014, and can still be found in Trollhättan.</p>

      <h2>CMS Group</h2>
      <p>Logo and graphic manual, for a car dealership in Gothenburg, Sweden. At the time CMS was an authorised Volvo dealer, so I used colors from Volvo's design manual to allow colorful designs that would not clash with Volvos colors. I chose an orange color that was not used much at the time (most Volvo dealers used blue). The logo and color is still in use: <a href="http://www.cmsgroup.se/">CMS Group website</a></p>
      <p>I also produced newspaper ads and other printed material with this design for CMS at the time.</p>

      <h2>Entreprenörsdagen</h2>
      <p>Logo, printed material. Entreprenörsdagen was an annual event with speakers on entrepreneurship in Sweden. For two consecutive years, I did the overall art direction for the events and produced flyers, invitations, roll-ups and other material. Below is an invitation for 2005. The theme of the year was <em>internationalism</em>, so I did a design that took inspiration from the UN flag, and classical 1950's graphics of the Dag Hammarskjöld era.</p>
